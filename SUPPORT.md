# Getting support with packages

If you identify an issue, please open an issue with the respective repo. Do NOT open an issue on `apt-swarm/repo` as that is reserved for issues with the repo itself.
If an issue is identified to be part of the upstream repository, you will be directed to open an issue there.

List of packages:

- [A Neuro Who Can't Sing](https://github.com/apt-swarm/A-neuro-who-can-t-sing)
